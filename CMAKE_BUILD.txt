CMake can be used to build a JNI interface for Wapiti and a static Wapiti library for your environment of choice, for instance for unix:

1. cd <wapiti_root> 
2. mkdir build; cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. In the build folder there will be a library libwapiti.so or libwapiti.dylib (mac os x)

The library should not contains dynamic dependencies (for portability of the JNI), which can be checked on Linux by the command:
> ldd libwapiti.so

or on Darwin architecture:
> otool -L libwapiti.dylib

The jar file can we found under src/swig.
