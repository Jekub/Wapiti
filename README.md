# Wapiti

This is a fork of [Wapiti][wapiti].  Please see the [original
site][wapiti] for the definitive source.

## My Fork

This version has been modified to support:

 * Support for Windows.
 * Streaming IO interface for loading data in leiu of reading files
    off disk.
 * Intentional support for C# via P/Invoke.

This fork builds upon and makes use of other forks.  These forks
provide the following features.

 * CMake, cross-platform build system, instead of Make, allowing to
   build the library more easily in the environment of your choice.
 * Remove most uses of VLA (i.e. `main(int argc, char*[argc]
   argv)`. Instead, `main(int argc, char** argv)` is used).
