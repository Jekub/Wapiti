/*******************************************************************************
 * Linear chain CRF model
 *
 *   There is three concept that must be well understand here, the labels,
 *   observations, and features. The labels are the values predicted by the
 *   model at each point of the sequence and denoted by Y. The observations are
 *   the values, at each point of the sequence, given to the model in order to
 *   predict the label and denoted by O. A feature is a test on both labels and
 *   observations, denoted by F. In linear chain CRF there is two kinds of
 *   features :
 *     - unigram feature who represent a test on the observations at the current
 *       point and the label at current point.
 *     - bigram feature who represent a test on the observation at the current
 *       point and two labels : the current one and the previous one.
 *   So for each observation, there Y possible unigram features and Y*Y possible
 *   bigram features. The kind of features used by the model for a given
 *   observation depend on the pattern who generated it.

 *   Synchronize the model with its reader. As the model is just a placeholder

 *   sync will get the labels and observations count as well as the observation
 *   kind from the reader and build internal structures representing the model.
 *
 *   If the model was already synchronized before, there is an existing model
 *   incompatible with the new one to be created. In this case there is two
 *   possibility :
 *     - If only new observations was added, the weights of the old ones remain
 *       valid and are kept as they form a probably good starting point for
 *       training the new model, the new observation get a 0 weight ;
 *     - If new labels was added, the old model are trully meaningless so we
 *       have to fully discard them and build a new empty model.
 *   In any case, you must never change existing labels or observations, if this
 *   happen, you need to create a new model and destroy this one.
 *
 *   After synchronization, the labels and observations databases are locked to
 *   prevent new one to be created. You must unlock them explicitly if needed.
 *   This reduce the risk of mistakes.
