/* mdl_t:
 *   Represent a linear-chain CRF model. The model contain both unigram and
 *   bigram features. It is caracterized by <nlbl> the number of labels, <nobs>
 *   the number of observations, and <nftr> the number of features.
 *
 *   Each observations have a corresponding entry in <kind> whose first bit is
 *   set if the observation is unigram and second one if it is bigram. Note that
 *   an observation can be both. An unigram observation produce Y features and a
 *   bigram one produce Y * Y features.
 *   The <theta> array keep all features weights. The <*off> array give for each
 *   observations the offset in the <theta> array where the features of the
 *   observation are stored.
 *
 *   The <*off> and <theta> array are initialized only when the model is
 *   synchronized. As you can add new labels and observations after a sync, we
 *   keep track of the old counts in <olbl> and <oblk> to detect inconsistency
 *   and resynchronize the model if needed. In this case, if the number of
 *   labels have not changed, the previously trained weights are kept, else they
 *   are now meaningless so discarded.
