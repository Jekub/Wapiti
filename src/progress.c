 * User interaction during training
 *
 *   Handle progress reporting during training and clean early stoping. Trainers
 *   have to call uit_progress at the end of each iterations, this will display
 *   various informations for the user.
 *   Timing is also done here, an iteration is assumed to take all the time
 *   between to call to the progress function and evualtion on the devel data
 *   are included.
 *
 *   This module setup a signal handler for SIGINT. If this signal is catched,
 *   the uit_stop global variable to inform the trainer that it have to stop as
 *   early as possible, discarding the recent computations if they cannot be
 *   integrated very quickly. They must leave the model in a clean state. Any
 *   further signal will terminate the program. So it's simple :
 *     - 1 signal mean "I can wait a little so try to stop as soon as possible
 *         but leave me a working model"
 *     - 2 signal mean "Stop immediatly what you are doing, I can't wait and
 *         don't care about getting a working model"
